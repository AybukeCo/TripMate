📌 Tech Stack for Collaborative Travel Planner App
1️⃣ Frontend (Mobile App)
Since it's a mobile app, the best choice is: 
✅ React Native – Cross-platform development (iOS & Android)
✅ Expo (Optional) – If you want easier development and built-in libraries (e.g., camera, push notifications)

2️⃣ Backend (Server + Real-Time Features)
You'll need a backend that can handle real-time data, authentication, and file storage. The best options:
✅ Node.js + Express.js – Lightweight and scalable backend
✅ WebSockets (Socket.io) – For real-time features like group chat and live updates

3️⃣ Database Choices
Since your app has multiple types of data (itinerary, budget, photos, chats, polls, etc.), you'll need a combination of client-side storage (for offline access) and server-side storage (for collaboration).

📍 Client-Side Database (Offline Storage)
✅ SQLite (via Expo SQLite) – Store offline itineraries and budget when the internet is unavailable
✅ AsyncStorage (React Native) – Store user preferences and session data

📍 Server-Side Database (Cloud Storage)
✅ Firestore (Firebase) – Best for real-time collaboration, chat, and social polling
✅ PostgreSQL (or MongoDB) – If you need structured data (SQL) or flexible NoSQL for travel itineraries
✅ Cloud Storage (Firebase Storage or AWS S3) – Store uploaded images and documents

4️⃣ Real-Time Collaboration & Features
Since your app requires live updates, chat, and polling, you need real-time communication:
✅ Socket.io (WebSockets) – For real-time chat, notifications, and live updates
✅ Firestore Database (Firebase Realtime DB or Firestore) – For syncing data like itinerary changes and polls

5️⃣ Authentication & User Management
Your users need to sign in and collaborate in groups, so authentication is crucial:
✅ Firebase Authentication – Easiest way to support Google, Facebook, and email login
✅ Auth0 or Supabase Auth – If you need a more scalable alternative

6️⃣ Image Uploading & File Management
Since users will upload travel photos, receipts, and itinerary documents, you need cloud storage:
✅ Firebase Storage – Simple and scalable for storing user-uploaded images
✅ AWS S3 – More flexible, scalable, and cost-effective for large-scale apps

7️⃣ Finance Management
If users track expenses and split costs, your backend should:
✅ Use Firestore/PostgreSQL – Store budget, expenses, and contributions
✅ Integrate Stripe API or PayPal API – If you want to handle real payments between users

🔗 API & Communication
Your mobile app needs to talk to the backend efficiently:
✅ REST API (Express.js + Node.js) – For handling standard requests
✅ GraphQL (Apollo Server + Client) – If you need optimized, flexible queries

🚀 Deployment & Hosting
Frontend (Mobile)
Expo Go – For easy testing
Google Play Store & Apple App Store – For publishing
Backend (API & WebSockets)
Firebase Hosting – If using Firestore
Vercel – If using Next.js for backend API
Render or Heroku – If using Express.js
Database Hosting
Firebase Firestore (NoSQL, real-time)
Supabase (PostgreSQL alternative to Firebase)
MongoDB Atlas (for NoSQL needs)
💡 Final Tech Stack Recommendation
✅ Frontend: React Native (with Expo for easier dev)
✅ Backend: Node.js + Express.js + WebSockets (Socket.io)
✅ Real-Time Data: Firebase Firestore
✅ Client-Side Storage: SQLite (for offline itinerary)
✅ Cloud Database: Firestore + PostgreSQL (for structured data)
✅ Authentication: Firebase Auth or Supabase Auth
✅ File Uploads: Firebase Storage or AWS S3
✅ Finance Management: Firestore + Stripe API

🎯 Next Steps
Set up React Native project (Expo or bare React Native)
Set up Firebase for authentication and real-time database
Build backend with Express.js and WebSockets for live updates
Integrate chat, image uploads, and budget tracking
